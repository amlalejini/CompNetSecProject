Hey Ryan,

I had a great time at my birthday party yesterday.  Thanks for bringing that bouncy house!  My daughter, Irene, loved it!

I’m having some trouble with internet on my machine.  I just can’t connect.  I sure hope Eve hasn’t guessed my password again.  Can you help me out?

Thanks,
Bryan Cranston
